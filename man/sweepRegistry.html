<h2>Sweep obsolete files from the file system</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removes R scripts, log files, resource informations and
temporarily stored configuration files from the
registry's file directory. Assuming all your jobs
completed successfully, none of these are needed for
further work. This operation potentially releases quite a
lot of disk space, depending on the number of your jobs.
BUT A HUGE WORD OF WARNING: IF you later notice something
strange and need to determine the reason for it, you are
at a huge disadvantage. Only do this at your own risk and
when you are sure that you have successfully completed a
project and only want to archive your produced
experiments and results.
</p>
